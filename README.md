# Covid19-predictor
Covid-19 predictor, a semester-end project made using Machine learning concepts. 
Our machine learning agent predicts whether a patient is positive based on symptoms provided by the patient. Our model predicted COVID-19 test results with high accuracy using only eight binary features: sex, age â‰¥60 years, known contact with an infected individual, and the appearance of five initial clinical symptoms.
As part of our work, we used ML Supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, naive bayes, and boositing techniques including LightGBM and XGBM. It was found that LightGBM was the most accurate out of these scoring 95.7181% followed by Decision Tree. 

Data:
- This research is not without shortcomings. We relied on the data reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, which has limitations, biases and missing information regarding some of the features. All the data used in this study were retrieved from the Israeli Ministry of Health website11. The dataset was downloaded, translated into English, and can be accessed at: https://github.com/nshomron/covidpred.
